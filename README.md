# Active-Learning-Strategies-Across-Diverse-Machine-Learning-Models
Choose a subset of query strategies from the modal active learning library and compare how well they perform for a shallow classifier (e.g., logistic regression) trained on MNIST and optionally for a deep neural network (e.g., a CNN with few hidden layers) trained on a reasonable subset of CIFAR 10.
